This is a simple yet effective 1st Person Controller for Unity 3D. If you are looking for a realistic (sort of heavy movement which is characteristic of a human walk) movement for your project this is for you.

Game Mechanics:

 • Rigidbody Movement
 • Rigidbody Jump
 • Sprint
 • Camera Follows

//Using Forcemodes the movement is life like, the force of jump is controlled by whether or not you are sprinting by different values, camera has a smooth delay while adapting to a new position while locking on -90 and 90 degrees on axis.

Components Needed:

 • Capsule Collider
 • Rigidbody
 • PlayerController

//This 3 are essential, Capsule collider is needed to interact with the world and use the mechanics, Rigidbody is needed to use Unity physics (45 mass is recommended, freeze rotation on 3 axis essential), PlayerController because obviously.

The best part about this script is, it is modifiable because of it's simplicity, change it to suit your projects.
